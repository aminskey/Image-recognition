# Image‚Äërecognition

A lightweight Python toolkit for object detection, image comparison, and vision-based experiments.

## üöÄ Why Use This?

- Simple, ready-to-run scripts for common vision tasks (object detection, image similarity)  
- Minimal dependencies and easy to extend  
- Great starting point for prototyping computer vision ideas  

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

| Module / File | Purpose |
| -------------- | ------- |
| `Object_detection.py` | Detects and localizes objects in images or video streams |
| `image_comp.py` | Compares two images and computes similarity / difference metrics |
| `example.py` | Demo for using the library end-to-end |
| `data/` | Sample images or dataset placeholders |
| `freeway.mp4`, `amogus.gif` | Example media files for model testing |

## üí° Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aminskey/Image-recognition.git
   cd Image-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Use `pip` or `conda` to install required packages (e.g. OpenCV, numpy, etc.)

3. **Run the demo**  
   ```bash
   python example.py
   ```
   It shows detection and comparison in action on example media.

4. **Use modules in your project**  
   ```python
   from Object_detection import detect_objects
   from image_comp import compare_images

   boxes = detect_objects("input.jpg")
   score = compare_images("img1.jpg", "img2.jpg")
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Possibilities

- Object detection using standard CV or ML approaches  
- Image comparison based on feature matching, structural similarity, or pixel-wise metrics  
- Easily integrate new models (e.g. deep learning detectors)  
- Use for research, automation, or educational purposes  

## üß© Contributing & Extensions

- Add new detection backends (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow)  
- Expand similarity metrics (e.g. perceptual loss, embedding distance)  
- Support video processing, batch pipelines, or real-time streams  
- Write tests, add more sample data, or improve documentation
